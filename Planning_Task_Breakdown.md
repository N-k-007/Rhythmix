# Rhythmix Development Plan & Task Breakdown

## Strategic Development Roadmap

### ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Starting Point: Backend API Foundation

**Why Start with Backend?**

- **API-First Approach:** All platforms (web, mobile, desktop) depend on the backend
- **Data Foundation:** Database schema and models are critical for all features

## Why This Approach Works Best

### 1. Backend-First Strategy

- **API as Foundation:** All client applications depend on the backend
- **Data Integrity:** Proper database design prevents future issues
- **Scalability:** Backend can handle multiple client types
- **Testing:** Easier to test core functionality in isolation

### 2. Incremental Development

- **Week-by-Week Milestones:** Clear deliverables each week
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identify issues early in the process
- **Feedback Loops:** Regular testing and validation
- **Flexibility:** Can adjust priorities based on progress

### 3. Technology Alignment

- **Your Requirements:** Directly addresses your comprehensive breakdown
- **Cross-Platform:** Supports web, mobile, and desktop from the start
- **Modern Stack:** Uses the technologies you specified
- **Scalable Architecture:** Monorepo structure for code sharing
